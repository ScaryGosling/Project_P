Dawn of Battle

Composer: Kristofer Eng

A staple theme in our library that takes the player on a journey; from the first tentative steps in pianissimo to a stirring finale 
in fortissimo. This theme invokes a dark, mysterious atmosphere with threads of sadness and resolve.

Track 2 : Strings
Track 3 : Brass
Track 4 : Percussion

Stinger 1 and 2 are timpani stingers
Stinger 3 is a timpani/percussion stinger
Stinger 4 is a pickup stinger


About the composer:

Kristofer Eng is one of the founders and the initial architect for the Elias music engine. Working as the head of the musical 
department at Elias Software he spends his time developing and improving the engine itself, as well as producing a steady stream
of new original compositions for the Elias production music library. If you would like to hire Kristofer for your next production, 
you can do this in one of two ways:

1. Contact Elias Software and request a theme which will then be added to the music library. The theme will be composed based on 
your requirements, but will then be made available for purchase on the website. You do not own the theme, but you can use it under 
the same terms as the other themes in our library. Contact Elias Software for a custom quote.
2. If you would like exclusive rights/a total buyout of the music, you may contact Kristofer privately. He would then act independently
as the composer for your title, and you would own full and exclusive rights to all the material. This would be a more expensive option
 than the one described above, but guarantees that the music in your game will be unique and entirely your own.
