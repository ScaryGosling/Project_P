  description: Fighters are skilled warriors that excel in melee! They employ a variety
    of offensive and defensive skills to trample over their enemies while absorbing
    damage through shields and healing strikes. They use rage to fuel their abilities,
    which is gained by attacking the enemy. Rage will decay after a short time. They
    also have durability on their weapons, each basic attack will drain durability.
    Upon reaching zero durability, the weapon will break and the fighter will receive
    a big damage penalty on all of their attacks. Repairkits in the shop and pickups
    on the map restore durability.
